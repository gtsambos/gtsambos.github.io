*1st May, 2019*

Between May and August of this year, I'll be in Oxford visiting the Big Data Institute.

I'll also be at a few conferences:

 - Quantitative Genomics 2019
 - SMBE Speciation Satellite Meeting
 - SMBE Main Meeting
 - Probabilistic Modelling of Genomes

Please get in touch if you'd like to meet while I'm here!
