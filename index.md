**Hi!**

(This site is a work-in-progress...)

I'm Georgia, a PhD student in the School of Mathematics and Statistics and Melbourne Integrative Genomics, both at the University of Melbourne in Australia. 
I'm originally from Sydney, but I moved to Melbourne for study a few years ago.

My PhD research is about identifying genetic signatures of admixture and local ancestry with statistics. Admixture occurs when organisms from two (or more) genetically distinct populations mix together to produce offspring of 'mixed ancestry'. Local ancestry refers to the ancestral origin of distinct genomic segments within an admixed individual. Studying this ancestry can yield insights about demography, migratory history, evolution and disease.

# Some formative professional experiences

- **Economics:** I did an internship with the [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://www.rba.gov.au/)'s Economic Research division over the summer of 2013-2014.  

- **Climate Science:** I did an internship with UNSW's [Climate Change Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) over the summer of 2014-2015.

- **Teaching and scientific communication:** I have experience teaching both technical and discursive subjects in a tertiary setting. (UNSW Calculus, UNSW SCIF, UNSW Curious Minds)

- **Student community organising:** I've been heavily involved in various groups that foster a sense of professional community amongst mathematicians and statisticians. I'm currently the Young Statisticians Representative for the Victorian branch of the [Statistical Society of Australia](https://www.statsoc.org.au/), and have led a number of events in that role. I have previously been an advocate for students in various positions of leadership in Unimelb's STAMPS (Statistics and Maths Postgrad Society), and UNSW's MathSoc.

- **Music:** Most of my free time is spent playing guitar. I have qualifications in jazz guitar from the [Sydney Conservatorium of Music's Open Academy](https://openacademy.sydney.edu.au/Short+Courses), and can occasionally be spotted backing up my friends at [LongPlay](http://www.longplay.net.au/) in Melbourne.
