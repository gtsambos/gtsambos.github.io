**Hi!**

I'm Georgia, a PhD student in statistical genetics at the University of Melbourne in Australia. 
I'm originally from Sydney, but I moved to Melbourne for study a few years ago.


Read on to learn about my professional experience and other information about me.


# Things I care about


My research focuses on statistical methodologies for learning about genetics and ancestry.

I am particularly interested in studies of admixture. Admixture occurs when organisms from two (or more) genetically distinct populations mix together to produce offspring of 'mixed ancestry'. 

I have extensive experience teaching both technical and discursive aspects of mathematics and statistics.


# Programming experience

I have extensive experience with
- R
- Python
- Markdown
- LaTeX
- Bash scripting
- Git
- TikZ
with particular proficiencies in scientific and statistical computing and data visualisation.
